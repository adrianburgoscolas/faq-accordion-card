## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I was be able to level up my skill using a Mobile-first workflow and practicing Semantic HTML5 markup and styling whit plain CSS also improving coding accessible web pages and web components. Also coded an accordion without JavaScript(just plain CSS).

### Continued development

Need to keep improving Semantic HTML5 and accessibility.
